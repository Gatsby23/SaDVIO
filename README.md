# SaDVIO

This library provide a modular C++ framework dedicated on research about Visual Odometry (VO) and Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO). This framework uses a factor graph sparsification approach for efficient state estimation and enables local dense 3D reconstruction via a meshing module. This approach Sparsifies and Densifies VIO (SaDVIO). It also contains implementations of research works done at ISAE such as non overlapping field of view VO. This work will be made open source soon, contact us at cesar.debeunne@isae-supaero.fr for more informations.
